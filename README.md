<h2> How did I complete this project? </h2>

<p> I started by creating divs and adding elements within them. I assigned classes to each div and moved onto the CSS. I imported the required fonts, started by removing some default browser styles, and began styling the header. I used my prior knowledge, split up the header into two sides, and used the appropriate flexbox properties to get the design I wanted. Next, I moved onto the title section, where I styled the heading, text and spent some time figuring out the design for the button and hr. I got the image to the size I wanted, and got it positioned to fit the section properly. Then, I moved onto the section2, where I once again used prior knowledge to get the right layout. I used properties like align self, flex direction, and more to get the cards spaced out. Now, I started to design the find out more section, where I used properties like margin and padding to get the right spacing between the text and the buttons. Then, I created the footer where I split up sections of links, added a top part with the logo and social media logos, and styled the links and headings. Lastly, I spent some time working on hover effects and added some media queries to contiune my progress towards learning responsive layouts and web design. Before deploying my website, I checked out the functionality and design on multiple browsers, and used the built-in device emulation feature to see how it would look on different screen sizes. My next steps would be to further improve my background positioning, and responsive design skills.Â </p>
